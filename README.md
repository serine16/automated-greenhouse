# Automated-Greenhouse

Automated greenhouse system built during CEGEP final project course using Arduno and environmental sensors.
The goal of the project was to monitor greenhouse conditions and automatically control systems such as ventilation watering and empty reservoir alert based on sensor readings.

## Overview

The system collects environmental data (humidity, temperature, water-level) and triggers actuators when certain thresholds are reached.
This helps maintain stable growing conditions with minimal manual intervention.

This project combines embedded programming, some basic automation logic, and hardware wiring.
